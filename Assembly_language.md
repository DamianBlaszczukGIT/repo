# Assembly language
- **Info**:
Assembly language is a low-level programming language that is closely related to machine code. It uses symbolic representations of a computer's architecture, allowing programmers to write instructions in a more human-readable form. Each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture, making it hardware-dependent. Assembly language provides control over system resources and hardware, enabling efficient programming for performance-critical applications. It is often used in system programming, embedded systems, and performance optimization, but requires a deep understanding of the underlying hardware.
