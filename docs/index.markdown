TIOBE Index for March 2025

It is interesting to see that very old languages are sneaking into the TIOBE index top 20. Fortran and Delphi are competing for a top 10 position, whereas COBOL and this month's new entry Ada are a little bit further down the list. All of them show an uptrend. Why is this? Why aren't the new and promising languages shining instead?

I think that it has to do with the many vital legacy systems that keep the world running. Most of them are developed with the aid of these dinosaur languages. Now that the last of the core developers of these systems are about to retire, companies avoid any risk and choose to keep the existing systems and even extend them rather than replacing them by newer systems based on more modern languages. Note that we name these languages dinosaurs, but they have evolved over time and are pretty up to date. All of them have new language definitions. Check out Fortran 2023, Delphi 12 (released in 2024), Ada 2023 and COBOL 2023. We might frown to see these languages being in the TIOBE index top 20, but they definitely serve a purpose and deserve credit.

The TIOBE Programming Community index is an indicator of the popularity of programming 
languages. The index is updated once a month. The ratings are based on the number of 
skilled engineers world-wide, courses and third party vendors. Popular web sites
Google, Amazon, Wikipedia, Bing and more than 20 others are used to calculate the ratings.
It is important to note that the TIOBE index is not about the best programming language or the language
in which most lines of code have been written.
The index can be used to check whether your programming skills are still up to date or to make a 
strategic decision about what programming language should be adopted when starting to build a new 
software system. The definition of the TIOBE index can be found here.
