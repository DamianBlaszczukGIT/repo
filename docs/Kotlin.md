# Kotlin
- **Info**:
Kotlin is a statically typed programming language developed by JetBrains, designed to be fully interoperable with Java. It runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and can also be compiled to JavaScript or native code. Kotlin emphasizes safety, conciseness, and tooling support, making it popular for Android app development. It was officially released in 2011 and has gained widespread adoption, particularly after Google announced official support for Android development in 2017.
