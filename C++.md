# C++
- **Info**:
C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in the early 1980s. It is an extension of the C programming language, incorporating object-oriented features, which allows for better data abstraction and code organization. C++ supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming. It is widely used in software development for systems, applications, and game programming due to its performance and flexibility. The language has a rich standard library and is known for its complex syntax and features like manual memory management.
