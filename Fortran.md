- **Info**:
Fortran, short for "Formula Translation," is a high-level programming language developed in the 1950s for scientific and engineering applications. It is one of the oldest programming languages still in use today. Fortran is known for its efficiency in numerical computation and array manipulation. Over the years, it has evolved through several versions, with Fortran 77, Fortran 90, and Fortran 2008 being notable updates. The language supports structured programming and has features for parallel computing, making it suitable for high-performance computing tasks.
