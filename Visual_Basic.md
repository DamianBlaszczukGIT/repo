# Visual Basic
- **Info**:
Visual Basic is a programming language and integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. It is designed for building Windows applications and is known for its ease of use, allowing developers to create graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with drag-and-drop features. Visual Basic is an event-driven language, meaning that the flow of the program is determined by user actions (events). It has evolved over the years, with versions like Visual Basic .NET, which integrates with the .NET framework, enabling the development of web and mobile applications. Visual Basic is widely used for rapid application development (RAD) due to its simplicity and efficiency.
