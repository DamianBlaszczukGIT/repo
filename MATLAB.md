# MATLAB
- **Info**:
To summarize a Wikipedia page in MATLAB, you can use the following approach:

1. **Read the Wikipedia page**: Use the `webread` function to fetch the content of the page.
2. **Extract the summary**: Parse the HTML content to find the introductory section or summary.
3. **Display the summary**: Use `disp` or `fprintf` to show the summary.

Hereâ€™s a simple example code snippet:

```matlab
url = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Page_Title';
content = webread(url);
% Use appropriate parsing to extract the summary
% This part requires HTML parsing, which can be done using regex or other methods
summary = extract_summary(content); % Define this function based on your needs
disp(summary);
```

Make sure to replace `'Your_Page_Title'` with the actual title of the Wikipedia page you want to summarize. Note that extracting the summary will require additional parsing logic based on the HTML structure of the page.
