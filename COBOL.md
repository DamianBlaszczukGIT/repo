# COBOL
- **Info**:
COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) is a high-level programming language designed for business, finance, and administrative systems. Developed in the late 1950s, it emphasizes readability and ease of use, making it suitable for data processing tasks. COBOL is known for its strong support for file handling and record processing. Despite being considered outdated by some, it remains in use today, particularly in legacy systems within government and financial institutions. Its syntax is verbose, which aids in understanding but can lead to longer code.
